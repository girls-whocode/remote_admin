## Welcome to the ARROW Main Menu
Experience the epitome of efficient server management with the Advanced Remote Resource and Operations Workflow (ARROW) application, version 2.0. Our interface is your gateway to a world of seamless system control, where each selection is an invitation to productivity. The RA application simplifies complexities, guiding you through an array of options presented with precision. Let's explore the main menu, a launchpad to streamlined administration.

## Overview: Navigating Possibilities
The main menu serves as your portal to the RA application's capabilities. Five distinct options are at your disposal, conveniently navigated using the arrow keys for selection and the enter key for execution. As you delve deeper, you'll discover submenus that keep you oriented and facilitate seamless navigation. Noteworthy is the dynamic nature of our menus; certain options unveil only when prerequisites are met, ensuring a guided and efficient experience.

Designed to accommodate diverse needs, this application seamlessly adapts from multi-server tasks to single-server operations.

## The Driving Force: Purpose and Scope
As a seasoned system administrator managing over 1700 servers, I recognized the power of automation in maintaining patching and performing administration tasks. My scripting prowess positioned me as a resource for automating routine duties, orchestrating tasks across a multitude of servers, and resolving complex infrastructure issues. This journey led to the inception of "Modules."

## Modules: Unleashing Customization
Central to our application's architecture is the "mods" directoryâ€”a haven of extensibility. Modules, the heart of versatility, await their moment on the stage. While dormant in the Alpha release, these modules represent a universe of possibilities. Evolving with user needs, they will enrich the menu, offering tailored options to enhance your experience.

## The Core: Navigating the Main Menu
At the heart of our application lies the main menu. Tailored to the demands of server management, it boasts two key options: "Remote Menu" and "Local System." The former leads you to a realm where hosts from diverse origins converge, while the latter empowers you to wield control over the local system. This dichotomy forms the bedrock of our interface, ensuring a comprehensive yet efficient experience.
