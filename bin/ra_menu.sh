# Function: 
#   action_menu
#
# Description:
#   This function provides an action-oriented sub-menu interface to perform various
#   remote operations on a specific host. Actions include running shell commands, diagnostics,
#   subscription refresh, file operations, and more.
#
# Parameters:
#   None
#
# Returns:
#   None; the function is procedural and leads to different operations based on user choices.
#
# Dependencies:
#   Calls utility functions like header, footer, draw_center_line_with_info, and select_option.
#   Utilizes other functions for the actual operations like shell_hosts, do_connection_test,
#   copy_ssh_key, refresh_subscription, local_diagnostics_main, remote_resources, snapshot,
#   local_system_info, deploy_updates, copy_file, get_file, vulnerability_scan, reboot_host_server,
#   shutdown_host_server, remote_menu, display_help, and bye.
#
# Interactivity:
#   Presents the user with a list of options to select using arrow keys and the Enter key.
#   Outputs directly to the terminal.
#
# Preconditions:
#   A hostname or host group must be specified (${hostname} must be non-empty). If not,
#   the user will be redirected to the remote_menu.
#
# Notes:
#   The function contains conditional logic to redirect to remote_menu if no hostname is provided.
#   action_choice is used to capture the user's menu selection.
#
# Example:
#   Upon calling action_menu, the user will see a menu with options such as "Shell into Systems",
#   "Test Connection", "Copy SSH Key", etc. The selected option will trigger a corresponding action or another sub-menu.

#   None; this function operates in a procedural manner to guide the user through the database management process.
#
# Dependencies:
#   This function relies on utility functions like header, footer, draw_center_line_with_info, and select_option.
#   When a menu option is selected, the corresponding database management function is called.
#
# Interactivity:
#   Presents a menu-based UI where users can use arrow keys to navigate and make selections using the Enter key.
#   Outputs are sent directly to the terminal.
#
# Preconditions:
#   Assumes that all dependencies for database operations are correctly configured and installed.
#
#
# Example:
#   The function will display a menu with options like "Load a Database", "Create a Database", "Modify a Database", etc.
#   Upon selection, the corresponding operation will be initiated.
