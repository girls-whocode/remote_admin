# Choice of Snapshot Technology
# Filesystem: Check whether you are using LVM, ZFS, or Btrfs, as each has its own snapshotting method.
# Virtual Machines: If you're running a VM, then the hypervisor may have its own snapshot capabilities. 
# Simple Backup: If you're not using any of the above, rsync or dd can also be used, although they may not provide true snapshot functionality.

# Pre-Snapshot Preparations
# Quiesce the Filesystem: Some filesystems may need to be made read-only or applications may need to be paused to ensure data consistency.
# Check for Existing Snapshots: Too many snapshots can fill up your storage or even make subsequent snapshots impossible.
# Resource Check: Ensure that there is enough disk space and that the system load is not too high to carry out the snapshot operation.

# Script Workflow
# Parameter Parsing: Process command-line options or configuration files.
# Logging: Decide on a logging mechanism to capture the success or failure of different steps.
# Notification: Add email notifications or system alerts in case of success/failure.
# Error Handling: Implement robust error checking after each operation to make sure each step succeeds before proceeding to the next.

# Cleanup and Post-Snapshot Actions
# Verification: Once the snapshot is done, verify its integrity.
# Retention Policy: Define and implement a snapshot retention policy.
# Application State: Restore application or filesystem state if they were paused or set to read-only.
