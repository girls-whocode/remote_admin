# Function Name:
#   load_database
#
# Description:
#   This function is designed to load server databases by identifying 
#   all files in a specified directory that match a particular pattern,
#   then loading these databases into an array for further operations.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Clears the screen and displays headers and footers.
#   2. Initializes an array 'db_files' to hold database file paths.
#   3. Checks if the specified directory exists.
#   4. Iterates through the directory, adding file names to 'db_files'.
#   5. Checks whether any files were found.
#   6. If files were found, calls the 'get_host_file' function for each file.
#
# Globals:
#   - db_files: An array that stores the paths of the database files.
#   - search_dir: The directory where the script searches for database files.
#   - app_logo_color: Color code for the app logo.
#   - app_ver: Version of the application.
#   - keep_running: A flag to control the loop.
#   - files_found: A flag to indicate whether any files were found.
#
# Parameters:
#   None.
#
# Returns:
#   None. Modifies global variable 'db_files' and calls other functions
#   like 'get_host_file' for further operations.

# Function Name:
#   add_server_to_database
#
# Description:
#   This function is responsible for gathering server information from the user
#   and appending it to a specified database file. The function first asks for a
#   required hostname and then collects optional server attributes like User, 
#   Identity File, IP Address, Jump Host, and Port.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Receives a database file path as an argument.
#   2. Reads the hostname from the user. If none is given, returns an error message and exits.
#   3. Reads other optional fields like User, Identity File, IP Address, Jump Host, and Port.
#   4. Appends the collected information as a comma-separated line to the specified database file.
#
# Globals Modified:
#   None. However, it writes to the file specified by the argument.
#
# Globals Read:
#   None.
#
# Parameters:
#   db_file - The file path to the database where the server information will be appended.
#
# Returns:
#   1 - if the required 'HostName' field is empty.
#   Otherwise, implicitly returns 0 after appending information to the database file.
#
# Called By:
#   Main program or another function requiring the addition of a server to a database.
#
# Calls:
#   - read: Built-in bash command to read user input.
#   - echo: Built-in bash command to write to the standard output or file.

# Function Name:
#   create_database
#
# Description:
#   This function creates a new server database with a user-defined name.
#   It sanitizes the name for file system safety, checks for duplicates, 
#   and gives the user an option to populate the newly created database
#   with server information.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Display header and footer with information.
#   2. Prompt the user to input a database name.
#   3. Sanitize the database name for file system safety.
#   4. Add a "radb_" prefix to the sanitized database name.
#   5. Check if the database name is empty or already exists. If so, return with an error message.
#   6. Create a new file with the prefixed and sanitized database name.
#   7. Offer the user an option to add server entries to the newly created database.
#
# Globals Modified:
#   - New database file created in the "search_dir" directory.
#
# Globals Read:
#   - search_dir: The directory where the database will be created.
#
# Parameters:
#   None.
#
# Returns:
#   1 - if the database name is empty or already exists.
#   Otherwise, implicitly returns 0 after successful database creation.
#
# Called By:
#   Main program or other functions that require database creation.
#
# Calls:
#   - touch: Unix command to create an empty file.
#   - add_server_to_database: A function to add server information to a database.
#   - read: Built-in bash command to read user input.
#   - echo: Built-in bash command to display output.

# Function Name:
#   update_server_record
#
# Description:
#   This function updates an existing server record in a specified database file.
#   It reads the database line-by-line, compares the hostname, and updates the
#   corresponding record with new values provided by the user.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Accepts the database file and the hostname to be updated as arguments.
#   2. Creates a temporary file to store the updated records.
#   3. Iterates through each line in the database file.
#   4. Compares each hostname with the search_hostname.
#   5. If a match is found, prompts the user to enter new values for each field.
#   6. Writes the updated or existing record to the temporary file.
#   7. Replaces the original database file with the updated temporary file.
#
# Globals Modified:
#   - A temporary file is created and later replaces the original database file.
#
# Globals Read:
#   - None.
#
# Parameters:
#   db_file - The database file in which the server record exists.
#   search_hostname - The hostname of the server record to be updated.
#
# Returns:
#   None. Replaces the original database file with updated information.
#
# Called By:
#   Functions or sections of the script that require server record updates.
#
# Calls:
#   - mktemp: Unix command to create a temporary file.
#   - read: Built-in bash command to read user input.
#   - mv: Unix command to move/rename files.
#   - echo: Built-in bash command to display output.

# Function Name:
#   delete_server_record
#
# Description:
#   This function deletes a specific server record identified by its hostname 
#   in a given database file.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Accepts the database file and the hostname to be deleted as arguments.
#   2. Creates a temporary file to store the updated records.
#   3. Iterates through each line of the database file.
#   4. Writes each record to the temporary file unless the hostname matches 
#      the hostname to be deleted.
#   5. Replaces the original database file with the temporary file, thus
#      effectively deleting the specified server record.
#
# Globals Modified:
#   - A temporary file is created and later replaces the original database file.
#
# Globals Read:
#   - None.
#
# Parameters:
#   db_file - The database file from which the server record will be deleted.
#   search_hostname - The hostname of the server record to delete.
#
# Returns:
#   None. Replaces the original database file without the deleted record.
#
# Called By:
#   Functions or portions of the script that require server record deletions.
#
# Calls:
#   - mktemp: Unix command to create a temporary file.
